**Objective:** The project aims to identify and quantify sexist content in TV shows using sentiment analysis on their scripts.

**Methodology:** The project employs supervised learning algorithms, including SVM, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and LR, to detect and quantify sexism in TV show dialogues.

**Dataset:** Utilizing a dataset trained on a benchmark dataset with annotated dialogues as sexist or neutral, the project focuses on both explicit and implicit forms of sexism.

**Impact Assessment:** The primary goal is to raise awareness about negative stereotypes in popular TV shows and assess their potential impact on viewers, particularly adolescents and young adults.

**Prevalence Analysis:** By removing character labels from the dataset, the project seeks to analyze the overall prevalence of misogynistic themes in TV shows and understand how these themes may influence societal perceptions.

**Significance:** The proliferation of English language TV shows globally makes sentiment analysis crucial for identifying and addressing sexist and misogynistic tropes in media content.
